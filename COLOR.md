# Color

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I learn how to design a professional website, I will be learning how to use
color to convey meaning and create a comfortable experience for the user. 
There are conventions that every professional site uses.
- Color palette convention
  - One main color
  - One accent color (much less prominent than the main color)
  - Desaturated professional colors
    - Whites, grays, blacks, silvers
    - Colored elements are heavily desaturated

## Categories and Common Practice

### Logo and Company Colors
- Main logo is shown in the nav bar
  - Most times is positioned in the top left and is flush or in line with the
    navigation content
- The main color of the logo is present and definin

### Page
- Defines a majority of the color
  - A plurality of the page is the single color for the page background
- If it is a light, it is one shade from the lightest color or is the lightest
- If it is dark, it is one or two shades from darkest
- Line breaks using the "\<hr>" tag is still common
  - Some sites mix color separation with line separation 

### Nested and Asides
- Color added by going a shade up or down in content which is nested

### Graphical and Sectioning
- Shadows are almost non-existent
- Differences of color often act as a separator
- Contents which have a border have a very thin outline
  - The border is a moderate change in tone but not extreme
- Line breaks using the "\<hr>" tag is still common
  - Used sparingly and with purpose when present
  - Very thin and is often used both as an opposing shade as well as a 
    neighboring one
- Icons are extremely common
  - Typically transparent except for the icon itself
  - Consistent in color
  - Replaces the need for text like "Back" or "Next" instead opting for a 
    left or right arrow

### Nav
- Typically darker than the mid-tone shades
- Sticky and static positioning
- Contains logo which most if not all times establishes the main color
- Typically does not use an outline to separate, uses color instead
- Almost always contains a search feature
  - Some employ the magnifying glass icon which expands when clicked and 
    others use the icon and has a text box next to it
#### Double Nav
- Used for sites with a lot of content
- Often, one of the two is static and the other is sticky
  - Some have the double nav as a pop-out
    - This allows for both navs to be dense in content or features
- Many time, it is an optional nav revealed by a hamburger menu
- Some employ a loose navigation ability
  - These are often indended inside the page and is not very different in 
    style from other page content
  - We see this with documentation sites for chapters or topics
  - Combines navigation with content itself

###### Separation of Nav Duties
- One of them, typically the top one, is sparse in content and has content one
  the outer edges
- The other, typically a side nav, is dense in content which is typically
  user specific
  - GitHub uses it for showing user's repositories
  - Youtube lets you navigate your subscriptions, playlists, or subscriptions
  - Twitch shows your followed channels and recommended channels based on your
    account



### Footer
- Small or the smallest text on the page
- Contains logo, often in a different style or format
  - Logo is more neutral than the nav logo
### Buttons and Clickable Content
- Typically contains color, particularly the accent color or the most intense
  professional color
- Important buttons are the most saturated to entice navigation
- Navigation links which open in new tab may have extra styling
  - An arrow icon appended signals leaving the window



Terminology
- Main Color: the signature branding color of the website or company
- Accent Color: a color that is used to accent the main color
- Neutral Color: a color that is not the main or accent color

Professional colors are usually muted and dark but not too dark. These would 
be soft whites, grays or silvers, light navy blues, and blacks. Colors that 
would typically be bright like yellows or blues get softened and desaturated
quite a bit as to not shock the page. They will typically have a signature
company color or at the very least one main color which is not a designated
color for professionals. Rarely does a professional website use many or 
multitudes of saturated colors. There may be one other saturated color if need
be while heavily relying on the saturated color to liven the page amongst the
other muted, professional tones.

## Choosing Main and Accent Colors

Considering my saturated or main color will have many factors. Some of them
are:
- Choices of professional colors
  - Other colors affect the perception of another a la a palette
- Personal style and representation of myself
- Text readability

## Text Colors
