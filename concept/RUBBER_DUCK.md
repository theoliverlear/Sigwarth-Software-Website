# Questions to ask myself (the rubber duck method)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What is the point of my website?
- There is a lot of reasons to have a professional website. I will list a
  few reasons and then explains what the core purpose of my website is.
  The website offers a way to promote myself, it is a way to showcase my
  work. If I choose to write a book or sell a service, it is a way to
  advertise that. It is a way of showing my skills and qualifications.
  This will mostly be done via my projects and the site itself. It is a
  way to show who I am personally and be up to date with my life as I grow
  as a developer. It is an easy way to provide a way to contact me that
  offers multiple avenues for communication in one simple place. It would
  be an easy headlining link for a resume or for a business card.
- The point of the website is to show my work and promote myself in
  a professional manner while adding a personal touch that cannot be
  done with a resume.
## Is this a resume?
- Not necessarily, while it should be an indicator of my qualifications,
  it should not be a replacement for a resume. Instead, it is supposed to
  be a supplement to my resume and a way to promote myself. It can include
  information about me that would not be appropriate for a resume eg. a
  picture of myself, my updates on my projects, my thoughts on software
  and my writing, my possible products and services, and a more personal
  description of myself.
## Is this a portfolio?
- In part, yes. A section of the site will be dedicated to my work and
  projects. However, it will not be the point of the website. This means
  that the website is not just a reference to my work but also to myself.
