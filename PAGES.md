The vast majority of people visiting the site will only browse the landing 
page. Knowing this, the landing page should be the most important page on the
site. It should communicate the purpose of the site and immediately show the
user the architecture of the site. The user, like anything in life, will only
have a first impression of the site one time. It is important to make this
not only a good impression but a comforting one. I use the word comforting
very intentionally in this context. The user should feel comfortable with the
site so they can feel safe browsing it in the first place. The user should 
also feel comfortable with the site in the sense that they should be 
ingratiated with the site intuitively. Once a feature or page breaks that 
intuition, the user could react as something as small as confusion or as
extreme as frustration, mistrust, and a negative impression of me. This is
why it is important to make the site as intuitive as possible. While some
features could be a new experience for the user, it should not be a scary one.
For example, the user may not have used a dark mode before but it should not
be a large unknown consequence to the user by trying it.

# Pages

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Landing Page
#### Should the landing page be the home page?
- Yes, the landing page should be the home page. The landing page is the first
page the user will see and it should be the most important page on the site.
Knowing this, we have to determine where the most important page should be. A
typical website that has a landing page that is not the home page is a website
that typically is a product or service. The barrier to entry for the user is
sometimes a landing page that is a sales pitch. They may have a landing page
lead the user to a sign up for an account which they can be advertised from.
As it stands, I have no product or service that would warrant me to have a
landing page different from the homepage. I do not want people to be forced to
sign up to use my site nor do I want the first impression of my site to be
of a page that is solely focused on what would be an individual part of my 
site.

## Home Page
#### What should be on the home page?
- As the first page the user sees, the homepage should include many or most of
the style, architecture, and features of the site. These would include...
  - Navigation bar or hamburger menu
  - Color scheme
  - The purpose of the site
  
  I believe all of these should be prevalent in every page. To create a
comfortable experience, the user should be ingratiated with the site as soon
as they enter it.
